Trade-Data-vs-Market-Data
Project done for Ahool Capital trade firm.

This program compares several complicated factors between the firm's trade prices and the market value of a specific cryptocurrency. It allows for the input of any market data and trade log CSV file to be graphed in two possible visually comprehensible formats. 

The following image links are two sample graphs of either format.
