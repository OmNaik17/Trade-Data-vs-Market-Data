Trade-Data-vs-Market-Data - Analytics tool

This project was done for Celerix Technology - a cryptocurrency trading firm.

This program analyzes the firm's algorithmic trade prints against market prices of a specific cryptocurrency. It allows for the input of any market data and trade log as CSV files to be graphed in two possible visually comprehensible formats.

1. It overlaps trade events with market data bid/ask prices during the day
2. It provides market bid/ask price vs trade price to determine the relative level of the trade price

The following image links are two sample graphs of either format.
